# BIZy_ISE_BACC
We participated in the NUS-ISE Business Analytics Case Competition (BACC) in 2025 with our team name as BIZy. Our members consist of
- David Michael Indraputra
- Edward Rafael Lukito
- Glenn Chew
- Ryan Justyn

In this competition, we derived an LP model for a semiconductor company, and performed extensive simulations (Quasi Monte-Carlo) and probability calculations in order to gain new insights to further improve our model. Most of the work here is done in Python. This repository contains the code for the model, computations, and simulations that we did for the NUS-ISE Business Analytics Case Competition in 2025. It also contains our final report.
